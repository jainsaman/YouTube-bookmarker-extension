# YouTube Bookmarker Chrome Extension

This is a simple Chrome extension that allows you to bookmark YouTube videos using timestamps. The extension uses the Chrome storage API to store the timestamps.

I am using this to practice my JavaScript and Chrome extension development skills. I am also using this to learn how to use the Chrome storage API.
